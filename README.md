   ```bash
   pyinstaller FolderOrganizer.spec
   ```

2. **Find the Executable**  
   The generated executable will be located in the `dist` directory. Look for `FolderOrganizer.exe` (Windows) or `FolderOrganizer` (macOS/Linux).

```bash
python folderOrganizer.py
# Follow prompts to select directory
```

### Graphical Interface
